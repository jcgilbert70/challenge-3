# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

I modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The password can include special characters from the OWASP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## Motivation

I wanted to use JavaScript to allow users to creat a secure randomized password that meets criteria provided by the user. The user can select a password between 8 to 128 characters. The user can also decide if they want or need special characters, numeric characters, uppercase characters, or lowercase characters included within their randomized password.

## Comments

I have added comments to more easily understand the JavaScript code that I added to perform all requested features asked to be included.
